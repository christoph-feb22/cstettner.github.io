# About me

My name is Christoph Stettner and I'm a software developer. I'm not focused on a specific language.
In my daily business I am working with the .NET platform, mostly with C#.
For my side projects I'm workin with F#, Xamarin and ASP.NET as much as possible.
I often try some new technices to get new insights. So I will blog about my experiences with all that stuff.
